## Requirements
- Rust (latest stable version)
- QEMU (for RISC-V)
- RISC-V GNU Toolchain
- GNU Make
- GDB (for RISC-V)
## Getting Started
### Build the project
```sh
cargo xtask build
```
### Run in QEMU
```sh
cargo xtask run
```
### Run tests
```sh
cargo xtask test
```
### Debug with GDB
```sh
cargo xtask gdb
gdb-multiarch -ex "target remote :1234" -ex "set architecture riscv:rv64" -ex "file target/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/debug/glenda"
```
